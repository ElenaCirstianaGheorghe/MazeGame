# MazeGame

This game works by using text files that store the patterns of each level. These patterns are subsequently transformed into a matrix. The user moves the pawn on the game board through the keyboard arrows. This project uses threading and time modules in order to display a stopwatch which shows the time left for each level while the user is playing.
